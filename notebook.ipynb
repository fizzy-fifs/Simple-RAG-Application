The January 28, 2024 consolidated balance sheet was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements\\nincluded in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024, as filed with the SEC, but does not include all disclosures required by\\nU.S. GAAP . In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of\\nresults of operations and financial position, have been included. The results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results\\nexpected for any future period. The following information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto\\nincluded in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024.\\nIn May 2024, we announced a ten-for-one stock  split, or the Stock Split, of our issued common stock, which was effected through the filing of an amendment to\\nthe Company's Restated Certificate of Incorpor ation, or the Amendment, with the Secretary of the State of Delaware. In June 2024, the Company filed the\\nAmendment to effect the Stock Split and proportionately increased the number of shares of the Company’ s authorized common stock from 8.0 billion to\\n80.0 billion. Shareholders of record at the close of market on June 6, 2024 received nine additional shares of common stock, distributed after the close of market\\non June 7, 2024. All share, equity award and per share amounts presented herein have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the Stock Split.\\nSignificant Accounting Policies\\nThere have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\\nof the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024.\\nFiscal Year\\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January . Fiscal years 2025 and 2024 are both 52-week years. The second quarters of fiscal\\nyears 2025 and 2024 were both 13-week quarters.\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\nOur conden sed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA  Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances\\nand transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of finan cial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\\namounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue\\nand expense s during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimat es. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including\\nthose related to accoun ts receivable, cash equivalents and marketable securities, goodwill, income taxes, inventories and product purchase commitments,\\ninvestigation and settlement costs, litigation, other contingencies, property , plant, and equipment, revenue recognition, and stock-based compensation.

Any\\none of those  risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional\\nrisks, trends  and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immat erial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of\\noperations or reputation.\\nLong manu facturing lead times and uncertain supply and component availability , combined with a failure to estimate customer demand accurately ,\\nhas led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.\\nWe use third parties to manufacture and assemb le our products, and we have long manufacturing lead times. We are not provided guaranteed wafer , component\\nor capacity supply , and our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a quarter or year. If our estimates of customer demand are inaccurate, as\\nwe have experienced in the past, there could be a significant mismatch between supply and demand. This mismatch has resulted in both product shortages and\\nexcess inventory , has varied across our market platforms, and has significantly harmed our financial results.\\nWe build finished produc ts and maintain invento ry in advance of anticipated demand. While we have in the past entered and may in the future enter into long-\\nterm supply agreements and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs, or our\\nlong-term demand expectations may change. Additionally , our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary for the\\nfinished products are not available from third parties. This risk may increase as a result of our platform strategy . In periods of shortages impacting the\\nsemiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on orders for certain supply may be extended. We have previously\\nexperienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than 12 months. We have paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future\\nsupply and capacity , which have increased our product costs and may continue to do so. If our existing suppliers are unable to scale their capabilities to meet\\nour supply needs, we may require additional sources of capacity , which may require additional deposits.

With these additions, we have\\nalso entered and may continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both current and future products. The increased purchase\\nvolumes and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our supply chain may create more complexity in managing multiple suppliers with\\nvariations in production planning, execution and logistics. Our expanding product portfolio and varying component compatibility and quality may lead to\\nincreased inventory levels. We have incurred and may in the future incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments\\nexceed demand for our products or demand declines. Our customer orders and longer-term demand estimates may change or may not be correct, as we have\\nexperienced in the past.\\nProduct transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as our channel partners prepare to ship and support\\nnew products. We may be in various stages of transitioning the architectures of our Data Center , Gaming, Professional Visualization and Automotive products.\\nThe computing industry is experiencing a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse set of AI\\nopportunities. We have introduced a new caden ce of our Data Center architectures where we seek to complete a new GPU computing architecture each year\\nand we are providing a greater variety of Data Center offerings. The increased frequency of these transitions and the larger number of products and product\\nconfigurations may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating\\nproduct transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahea d of new product introductions can reduce or create volatility in\\nour revenue . We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for current generation architectures when customers anticipate\\ntransitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and future architecture transitions. If we are unable to\\nexecute our architectural transitions as planned  for any reason, our financial results may be negatively impacted. The increased frequency and complexity of\\nnewly introd uced products could result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could increase the magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty , or other\\ncosts or result in product delays. For example, we executed a change to the Blackwell GPU mask to improve production yield. Our gross margins in the second\\nquarter of fiscal year 2025 were negatively impacted by inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material and they may continue to be impacted in the\\nfuture.\\nWe incur significant engineering development resources for new products, and changes to our product roadmap may impact our ability to develop other products\\nor adequate ly manage our supply chain cost. Customers may delay purchasing existing product s as we increase the frequency of new products or may not be\\nable to adop t our new products as fast as forecasted, both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost.

Many end customers often do not purchase directly from us but instead purchase indirectly through\\nmultiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. As a result, the decisions made by our multiple OEMs, ODMs, system\\nintegrators, distributors, and other channel partners, and in response to changing market conditions and changes in end-user demand for our products, have\\nimpacted and could in the future continue to impact our ability to accurately forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various\\ndownstream parties.\\nIf we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production\\nand we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. If our contra ct manufacturers experience supply constraints, we may not be\\nable to increase supply to meet customer dema nd in a timely manner , or at all. If we cannot procure sufficient supply to meet demand or otherwise fail to fulfill\\nour custome rs’ orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damage d, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation\\ncould be harmed. Additionally , since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any\\none component have had and may have a broader revenue impact.\\nIf we overestimate our customers’  future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may\\nnot be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a reduction in average selling prices, including\\ndue to channel pricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a result of our overestimation of future demand, and we may\\nneed to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our products as a result of our suppliers’  increase in prices, and we may need to\\ncontinue to do so for other products in the future . We have also written down our inventory , incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments and may\\nhave to do so in the future. These impacts would  be amplified by our placement of any non-cancellable and non-returnable purchase orders placed in advance of\\nour historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products.

All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.\\nDemand estimates for our new products, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels. We may not be able to\\ngenerate significant revenue from them. Recent  technologies, such as generative AI models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for\\nData Center , the long-term trajectory is unknown. Because our products may be used in multiple  use cases and applications, it is difficult for us to estimate with\\nany reasonable degree of precision the impact of generative AI models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand.\\nChallenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead times may occur if\\nwe experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or other events. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan\\nand China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to\\nour supply continuity , could have a material adverse impact on us.\\nThe use of our GPUs other than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted and can in the future\\nimpact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, several years ago, our Gaming GPUs began to\\nbe used for mining digital currencies, such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of\\ncryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new\\ncompute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards and changes in\\nthe method of verifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further\\nimpact our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the Ethereum 2.0\\nmerge in 2022, have reduced and may in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This has created and may in the future create increased\\naftermarket sales of our GPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. In general, our new products or\\npreviously sold products may be resold online or on the unauthorized “gray market,” which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and\\nreseller marketplaces compete with our new products and distribution channels.\\nAdditionally , we depend on developers, customers and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain accelerated computing applications that leverage our\\nplatforms. We also rely on third-party content providers and publishers to make their content available on our platforms, such as GeForce NOW . Failure by\\ndevelopers, customers, and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain applications that leverage our platforms, or failure by third-party content providers\\nor publisher s to make their content available on reasonable terms or at all for use by our customers or end users on our platforms, could adversely affect\\ncustomer demand.\\nWe receive a significa nt amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a concentration of sales to'),\n",

Sales to direct Customers, A, B,\\nC and D represented 14%,11%, 11% and 10% of total revenue, respectively , for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, all of which were primarily attributable to\\nthe Compute & Networ king segment. With several of these channel partners, we are selling  multiple products and systems in our portfolio through their\\nchannels. Our operating results depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our\\nprocessors. We have a small number of partner s that are involved in system integration with our key customers. As our system design becomes increasingly\\ncomplex, system integrators may be unable to meet specifications of our key customers. Changes in our partners' or customers' business models or their\\nownership can reduce the number of partners available to us and harm our ability to sell our advanced data center systems to customers. In the future, these\\npartners may decide to purchase fewer products , not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way.\\nBecause most of our sales are made on a purch ase order basis, our customers can generally cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little\\nnotice to us and without  penalty . Our partners or customers may develop their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and\\nour partners  may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products, all of which may alter partners’  or customers’\\npurchasing patterns. Many of our customers often do not purchase directly from us but purchase through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors\\nand other channel partne rs. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, two indirect customers which primarily purchase our products through system integrators\\nand distributors, including through Customer B and Customer E, are estimated to each represe nt 10% or more of total revenue, attributable to the Compute &\\nNetworking segment.

In the\\nevent of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing\\nrequirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impa cted markets, including the Middle East. For example, the USG\\nhas already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for example by imposing license\\nconditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, and may impose additional conditions such as requiring chip tracking and throttling\\nmechanisms that could disable or impair GPUs  if certain events, including unauthorized system configuration, use, or location, are detected. The USG has\\nalready impo sed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands such controls to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a\\nsignificant portion of our supply and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. In\\naddition, as the performa nce of the gaming GPUs increases over time, export controls may have  a greater impact on our ability to compete in markets subject to\\nthose controls. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our products, which are warehoused in and distributed\\nfrom Hong Kong. Export  controls restricting our ability to sell data center GPUs may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers\\ncontaining our GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of'),\n",

The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of\\ndownstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a wider range of our products would likely have a\\ndisproportionate impact on NVIDIA  and may disadvantage us against certain of our competitors that sell chips that are outside the scope of such control.\\nExcessive or shifting export controls have alread y and may in the future encourage customers outside China and other impacted regions to “design-out” certain\\nU.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are able to serve markets worldwide. Excessive or\\nshifting export controls have already encourage d and may in the future encourage overseas governments to request that our customers purchase from our\\ncompetitors rather than NVIDIA  or other U.S. firms, harming our business, market position, and financial results. As a result, excessive or shifting export controls\\nmay negatively impact demand for our products  and services not only in China, but also in other markets, such as Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia.\\nExcessive or shifting export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. advanced semiconductor products, because by the time a new product is ready for\\nmarket, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may increase investment in foreign competitors,\\nwhich would be less likely to be restricted by U.S. controls.\\nAdditionally , restrictions imposed by the Chines e government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gaming\\nrevenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data  Center revenue. The Chinese government may also impose\\nrestrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products, or any products containing components made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the\\nChinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain products made by Micron, a supplier of ours. As another\\nexample, an agency of the Chinese government announced an Action Plan that endorses new standards regarding the compute performance per watt and per\\nmemory bandwidth of accelerators used in new and renovated data centers in China. If the Chine se government modifies or implements the Action Plan in a way\\nthat effectively prevents us from being able to design products to meet the new standard, this may restrict the ability of customers to use some of our data center\\nproducts and may have  a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Further restrictions on our products or the\\nproducts of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial results.\\n39'),\n",

General.\\n(a)Successor and Continuation of Prior Plans. The Plan is intended as the successor to and continuation of the NVIDIA Corporation\\n1998 Equity Incentive Plan (the “1998 Plan”), the NVIDIA Corporation 1998 Non-Employee Directors’ Stock Option Plan, the NVIDIA Corporation\\n2000 Nonstatutory Equity Incentive Plan, and the PortalPlayer, Inc. 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (together, the “Prior Plans”). Following the\\nEffective Date, no additional stock awards will be granted under any of the Prior Plans and all newly granted Stock Awards will be subject to the\\nterms of this Plan except as follows: from the Effective Date until September 30, 2007 (the “Transition Date”) (during which time the Company\\nanticipates taking such steps as are necessary or appropriate to permit participation in the Plan by Employees, Directors or Consultants who are\\nforeign nationals or are employed outside the United States), the Company may grant stock awards subject to the terms of the 1998 Plan\\ncovering up to an aggregate of 100,000 shares of Common Stock to newly hired employees of the Company and its Affiliates who are foreign\\nnationals or are employed outside the United States (such 100,000 share reserve, the “Foreign Transition Reserve”). On the Effective Date, all\\nof the shares remaining available for issuance under the Prior Plans will become available for issuance under the Plan; provided, however, that\\nthe issuance of shares upon the exercise of options or the settlement of stock awards granted under the Prior Plans (including the issuance of\\nshares upon the exercise or settlement of any awards granted following the Effective Date subject to the terms of the 1998 Plan from the Foreign\\nTransition Reserve) will occur from this Plan and will reduce the number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under this Plan as\\nprovided in Section 3 below. Any shares of Common Stock subject to outstanding options and stock awards granted under the Prior Plans that\\nexpire or terminate for any reason prior to exercise or settlement (collectively, the “Prior Plans’ Returning Shares”) will become available for\\nissuance pursuant to Stock Awards granted hereunder. Except as expressly set forth in this Section 1(a), all options and stock awards granted\\nunder the Prior Plans will remain subject to the terms of the Prior Plans with respect to which they were originally granted.\\n(b)Eligible Award Recipients. The persons eligible to receive Awards are Employees, Directors and Consultants.\\n(c)Available Awards. The Plan provides for the grant of the following Awards: (i) Incentive Stock Options, (ii) Nonstatutory Stock Options,\\n(iii) Restricted Stock Awards, (iv) Restricted Stock Unit Awards, (v) Stock Appreciation Rights, (vi) Performance Stock Awards, (vii) Performance\\nCash Awards, and (viii) Other Stock Awards.'),\n",

The Company, by means of the Plan, seeks to secure and retain the services of the group of persons eligible to receive\\nAwards as set forth in Section 1(b), to provide incentives for such persons to exert maximum efforts for the success of the Company and any\\nAffiliate, and to provide a means by which such eligible recipients may be given an opportunity to benefit from increases in value of the Common\\nStock through the granting of Stock Awards.\\n(e)Section 162(m) Transition Relief. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, any reference in the Plan to “performance-\\nbased compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Code will only apply to any Award that is intended, and is eligible, to qualify as such pursuant\\nto the transition relief provided by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) for remuneration provided by a written binding contract which was in\\neffect on November 2, 2017 and which was not subsequently materially modified, as determined by the Board, in its sole discretion, in\\naccordance with the TCJA and any applicable guidance, rulings or regulations issued by any governmental authority.\\n2.
